Self-study questions –Week 3

1. Describe the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm  
V(i, j) = function of the score of optimal alignments
V(0, 0) = 0
V(0, j) = V(0, j-1) + score(gap, T[j])
V(i, 0) = V(i-1, 0) + score()
0
2. What is ”banded alignment”?S
3. What is the local alignment problem?
4. What is the Smith-Waterman algorithm?
5. What is a semi-global alignment?
6. How does one compute a semi-global alignment?
7. How does one compute an alignment using an affine gap model
