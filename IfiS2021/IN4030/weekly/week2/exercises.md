Exercise 1  
1. The penalty for multiple gaps are much higher in alignment 2 than in alignment 1  
2. Like alignment 2, or even just A------ ... -------CG
3. Alignmnent 1; more identities  

Exercise 2  
The amino acid alignment because it has zero gaps  


Exercise 3  
--101101-11---11--

1. 0

2. -2

3. -10  


Exercise 4  

ACTGATCGACTGATCGATCGAGCTACT

-CTGATCGACTGATC-ATCGAGCTACT

L = H = G

G = len(S - indel)
H = len(S + 1 - indel)
L = 22
