# Weekly exercise set 1  

## TODO  

* Improve/correct my answers according to what I learned  

## What did i learn?  

* A way to properly allocate 2d array with underlying 1d array  

* Use clock instead of time. Get milliseconds by dividing clock * 1000 on clocks per sec  

* Realloc corrputs array when shrinking (find out about this)  

* Iterating through the file twice might be better than dynamically allocating the arrays
