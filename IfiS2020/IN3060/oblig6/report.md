It is entailed by the rule we made in the first execrise, quoting:
"Every trainer had interest in a race if a horse he/she trains competed in this race"

## 2 Connecting to dbpedia

I had to download the racehorse file to get it to work, so i added it in the delivery as an appendix

### Decisions and interpretation  

As dbpedia:Stallion is a dbp:sex, it is clear that dbpedia:Stallion and the class Stallion
are two different things. I interpreted dbpedia:Stallion as the value of the property
dbp:sex for any male horse

## 2.1 Questions
Individuals with sex: stallion

In the wings' grandfather is a blank node with the name "Northern Dancer" and there
