find all primes up to sqrt(n)
using traverseSmall
fill in in parallel


It seems that the process does not work because of race conditions within the byes

Proposals:
#1
 let all threads tick off their own versions of the sieve/table, then reduce the
 tables by and-ing all the bytes together
 pro:
  no need for synchronization
 con:
  copying the bytes might be slow and expensive in memory
  and-ing all the bytes together might be slow??

#2
 declare each part of the bytearray as belonging to thread-i, for that task
 this entails a high-low parameter for the traversal function

 pro:
  removes possibility of race conditions
 con:
  does not utilize all threas if one finishes before the rest
